### Why did I choose Python to implement this ?
I chose python simply because of the fact that I am very comfortable in Python programming compared to other languages.I was able to implement this with lesser lines of code compared to other languages, lesser time taken to complete and also made use of a module called heapq which helped me to implement heap queues quite easily
